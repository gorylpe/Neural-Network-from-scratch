# Neural Network from scratch

> Spontaneous project mid-course Machine Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng to summarize knowledge.

The goal is to implement basic features as in TensorFlow including:
- inference
- Dense layers
- 'linear', 'sigmoid', 'relu', 'softmax' activations
- training
- Adam optimizer

in `.NET` (and then in `Python`)
